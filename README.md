## Hello!

I'm a web dev enthusiast from birth & enjoyer of shiny new things.
I try to write clean code, probably to the detriment of my productivity.

Many of my projects are unfinished, but a learning experience nonetheless!
My first language was Lua, after English. My favourites are currently Rust & TypeScript.
